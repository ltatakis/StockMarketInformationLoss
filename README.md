# StockMarketInformationLoss

The project I am working for my MRes Dissertation. 
This project will use [R Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) and quantmod to process and visualise stock market data.

Through this process I aim to visualise the information loss that occurs during the interaction with the data which enables decision making.
Ultimately, this application will inform the user given the data they are viewing if the should invest.
